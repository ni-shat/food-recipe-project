### TESTEVA


Welcome to Testeva, a food recipe project that features various chefs and their recipes. 

* Our Chef section is where you can find all the chefs who contribute their recipes to our website. Each chef is displayed in a card, which includes their name and a brief description. When you click on the "View all recipes" button for each chef, you will be directed to the view recipes page for that particular chef.

* Clicking "View all recipes" button in the Chef section, you will be able to see the details of that chef and their recipes. However, this page is protected for authentication, so you must be a logged-in user to view the details. If you are not yet logged in, clicking the clicking this button will lead you to the login page. If you are not registered, you can sign up for an account.

* You can log in via Google or GitHub accounts, and after successful login, you will be redirected to the view recipes page of the specific chef you clicked on. 

* If you click on the "Login" button at the top of the page, you will be redirected to the home page after successfully logging in. 

* Your profile photo will be displayed at the top of the website, and if you have provided a name during registration, your name will also be displayed when you hover over your profile picture. If you have mistakenly provided an incorrect URL for your profile picture, an empty avatar will be displayed, but you can still see your name when hovering over it.

* The homepage also features food categories, and the latest recipes section allows you to see all the newest recipes. 

* In addition, we have a blog page that provides information about some React concepts, which you can download.
